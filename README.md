# ES6 DSL
Use `template strings` to call `functions` and build a `DSL` with `ES6 Javascript`.

# Server
```sh
./server
```

# Info
Code includes basic functions and extensions that attempt to make browser javascript programming enhanced.

# Javascript Syntax
An example of having `vim-javascript` detect custom DSL keywords can be seen
[here](https://github.com/afaur/vim-javascript/commit/1f3c0c230d0922b859dd4ca9cb1248e4876b1d20).
